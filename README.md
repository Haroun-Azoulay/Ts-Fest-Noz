This is the final project for my Master 2. It is a reservation platform and an interactive map that allows users to retrieve and add events. The project has been in development for approximately 1.5 years. It includes features such as OAuth2 authentication, an integrated payment system, e-commerce functionality, and microservices architecture. The project also incorporates MapBox for event visualization, multiple user roles, Swagger API documentation, and unit testing with Jest. Despite time constraints, it was deployed on Heroku while being developed in parallel with coursework.
 
Note: The site is primarily in French but english is better of course ! 

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Code Optimization & Factorization

Due to time constraints and parallel coursework, the code has not been fully optimized, and factorization was not implemented.
